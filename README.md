# DiscordCatBot V1.1
It's just supposed to be a copy of my cat for discord. It will meow every so often. Will also meow when mentioned.
# Commands
* saying 'auggie' in any part of a message will cause him to meows with tts. The tts can be disabled with 'auggie toggle tts'
* 'auggie add channel' will add the channel the message was sent in to a list. This will cause Auggie's random meows to appear on this channel
* 'auggie remove channel' will do the opposite of 'auggie add channel'
* 'auggie toggle tts' will toggle the tts functionality of the tts speech when saying 'auggie'
* 'meow now' will cause a random meow from Auggie however, this command will only work if @Cyakat#5061 (The owner, which is me) says it.
